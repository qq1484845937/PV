# PV
A dataset for photovoltaic power generation forecasting tasks.
# Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Dataset (Processed & De-identified)

## Data Description

This dataset contains processed and de-identified data used for photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting research.  
All values have been perturbed and normalized to protect data privacy.

### Columns:

| Column Name     | Description                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| time            | Relative day index (starting from 0)       |

| ir10            | Real power                         |
| irradiance      | Normalized irradiance               |
| temperature     | Normalized temperature             |
| wind_speed      | Normalized wind speed                  |
| wind_direction  | Normalized wind diection      |
| humidity        | Normalized humidity          |
| pressure        | Normalized pressure          |
## Data Processing Steps

1. Original time series smoothed to reduce noise  
2. Random multiplicative perturbation applied to numeric features  
3. Secondary smoothing to preserve continuity  
4. Minâ€“Max normalization applied to each column  
5. Sensitive fields removed or anonymized
